# foolstack

Just exploring what it's like to make a full stack app with GraphQL with a monorepo.
Mostly following along with this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ypD7qv3Z8&list=WL&index=13&t=153s and https://rushjs.io/pages/maintainer/setup_new_repo/

Nothing in here should be repeated or replicated. The app may never get finished, is going to use EXTREMELY insecure practices, and is only being used to brush up.
